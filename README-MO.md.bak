[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP/task-management-sample-app-sfsf-solutions)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP/task-management-sample-app-sfsf-solutions)

## Introduction

You can extend the functionality of your SAP SuccessFactors system with an extension application deployed in a subaccount in SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) and at the same time fully integrated in your SAP SuccessFactors system.

The goal of the **task management sample application for SAP SuccessFactors solutions** is to show some best practices when building SAP SuccessFactors extension applications on SAP BTP. We recommend to use this sample application only as a proof of concept and a starting point for implementing extensions. 

Using this application, you can:
 - Manage different tasks related to human resources (HR), and send them for approval to your colleagues
 - Move the employees in your company from one job title to another.
 - Approve the transfer of employees between positions and departments.
 - Hire new colleagues.

 The following diagram shows the technical components that take part in this scenario.

## Process

### 1. Connect the SAP SuccessFactors system you want to extend with the corresponding global account in SAP BTP

To do that, you must register your SAP SuccessFactors system in your global account in SAP BTP. During this process, an integration token is created and then used by the SAP SuccessFactors system tenant administrator to configure the integration on the SAP SuccessFactors system side.

1. In the SAP BTP cockpit, navigate to your global account, and then choose **System Landscape** > **Systems**.

2. In the **Systems** panel, choose **Register System**.

![In the **Systems** panel, choose **Register System**.](screenshots.png/1-systems-view.png)

3. In the **Register** System dialog box:

    1. Enter a name for the system you want to register.
    
     > Use only printable ASCII characters.
    
   ![Enter a name for the system you want to register.](screenshots.png/2-systems-view.png)

    2. In the **Type** dropdown list, select the system type.
    
   ![In the **Type** dropdown list, select the system type.](screenshots.png/3-systems-view.png)

    3. Choose **Register**.

    > SAP BTP generates an integration token that the tenant administrator of the extended SAP SuccessFactors system uses on the respective SAP SuccessFactors system side when configuring the integration between your SAP SuccessFactors system and the global account in SAP BTP.
    
4. Copy the integration token. You need it for configuring the integration on the extended SAP SuccessFactors system side.

5. Close the dialog box.

   The SAP SuccessFactors system appears in the list of registered systems. Its status is **Pending** because the registration process is not yet completed.
    
6. Configure the integration on the SAP SuccessFactors system side:

	* For SAP SuccessFactors, First Half 2021 Release:

		1. Open SAP SuccessFactors Provisioning.

		2. In the **List of Companies**, choose your SAP SuccessFactors company.

		3. In the **Edit Company Settings** section, choose **Extension Management Configuration**.

		4. In the **Integration Token** input field, paste the integration token.

		![In the **Integration Token** input field, paste the integration token.](screenshots.png/4-systems-view.png)
		
		5. Choose **Add**.

    		Wait for the integration to finish. You can check the status of the process with the **Check Status** button next to your system name.

	* For SAP SuccessFactors, Second Half 2021 Release or later:

		1. In **SAP SuccessFactors Admin Center**, navigate to **Extension Center**.

		>If you do not have permissions to access the Extension Center for the corresponding SAP SuccessFactors system, you need to send the integration token to a user with such permissions who will configure the integration on the SAP SuccessFactors system side.

		2. On the **Extensions on SAP BTP** tab page, navigate to the **Add Integration with SAP BTP** screen area, and paste the integration token in the **Integration Token** input field.
